   Updates galore.


 [Naveed Massjouni <naveedm9@gmail.com>]
 - Allow blessed objects to be logged


 [William Wolf <throughnothing@gmail.com>]
 - Add logging on errors.
   
   It seems the 'after' hook wasn't logging on error,
   so I made it subscribe to the 'after_error_render' hook
   in addition to the 'after' hook.
